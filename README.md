 Full Stack App with React and a REST API

 This project was part of the last module of the full stack javascript course I took with Treehouse.

 This API allows an authenticated user to create, update and delete their own courses from the database. The API was built with REST API/Express.js and the client side was built using React.

To start project:
Open api directory, install dependencies and start the project with yarn start;
Open new terminal window, open client directory, install dependencies and start the project with yarn start;


To circumvent CORS issues and successfully make requests from the React application's domain to the REST API's domain, I've enabled CORS support to the REST API application in the project files by pre-installing and configuring the cors npm package.
